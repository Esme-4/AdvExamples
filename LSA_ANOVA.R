# LDS LSADATA, chap 8 Daniel ANOVA
#
# Refer to the serum lipid-bound sialic acid data on 1400 subjects (LSADATA). We wish to conduct a study to determine 
# if the measurement of serum lipid-bound sialic acid (LSA) might be of use in the detection of breast cancer. The LSA 
# measurements (mg/dl) are for four populations of subjects: normal controls, A; patients with benign breast disease, 
# B; patients with primary breast cancer, C; and patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer, D. Select a simple 
# random sample of size 10 from each population and perform an appropriate analysis to determine if we may conclude that 
# the four population means are different. 
# Let Î± = .05 and determine the p value. 
# Test all possible pairs of sample means for significance. What conclusions can one draw from the analysis?
