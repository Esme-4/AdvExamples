Statistics and Regression Examples

We will use this repository to have some examples of solutions and general R code for statistics examples. The examples are from ANOVA examples and I will include some regression examples too. The idea is to cover examples of parametric (mean), non-parametric (median) and robust (trimmed means) methods, all using R and different R packages to estimate statistical tests and post hoc analysis.  
First we presetn [LSAdata OneWay](https://fabarrios.github.io/AdvExamples/) ANOVA example.  Starting with a large data file from the Daniel's Biostatistice book, the data is reformated to excecute a OneWay ANOVA analysis using different parametric functions in R.
