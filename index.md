These pages contain some solved problems and advanced examples from statistics subjects, many problems are taken from the Daniel's Biostatistics 
book. All the examples are solved using R ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))and different R packages, running over 
[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), the idea is to use this site as support of the different statistics courses I teach at UNAM. 
In particular I started with some ANOVA and regression examples.  

## Repeated OneWay ANOVA  
After loading data in R, the first step is to undesrtand the structure of anf format the data is, and restructure its ordes if needed to use the 
different R functions and the needed libraries, for the *post hoc* analysis. The first examples are from some large data sets (LDS) froms the end 
of chapter problems of Daniel's chapter 7.
